 # Hi there 👋 and please allow me to introduce myself ✨
 
🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm a frontend-driven backend-enthusiast -- plant freak 🪴 -- software engineer currently located in Connecticut.

🇧🇷 Although living in the US, I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. (Yes, I do miss it and visit often.)

🤍 I'm really passionate about projects that challenge me, and I dislike the feeling of being stuck in my comfort zone.

🌟 My tech stack: C#, JS and Python.

👩‍💻 Next on the study list: Go and Java.
