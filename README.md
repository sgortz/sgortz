# Hi there, nice to meet you 👋
👩🏻‍🎓 I’m currently a student at Hack Reactor, super excited to start my career as a Software Engineer!

Here's some my interesting facts about me:
- 👩🏻‍💻 I just finished a pretty cool project where I had to design, implement and deploy using AWS an API that supports an e-commerce application design by my peers at Hack Reactor
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fullstack application, and although it is still in the development stage, I can already say it will be related to one of my biggest hobbies: 🎬 movies 🎬
- ✍🏻 I’m currently learning Gatsby JS, and Firebase for this project 😅
- ⚡️ Fun fact: I love plants and I've been obsessed with creating moss terrariums 🌳
- 👉🏻 Pronouns: she / her / hers 

## 📫 Let's stay in touch:
