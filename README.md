 # Welcome! âœ¨
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, there! I'm Sabrina, and I'm a full-stack software engineer passionate about projects that take me out of my comfort zone and challenge me every day to become a better professional. I also love working collaboratively, so if you're looking for someone to work as a team, let's chat!


## Here's some interesting facts about me:
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· I'm from Brazil but currently, I live in Connecticut, US.
- ðŸ‘Œ I just finished a pretty cool project where I had to create a RESTful API that supports an e-commerce application designed by my peers at Hack Reactor. It was also my first time deploying an application using AWS.
- ðŸ‘½ Iâ€™m currently working on a fullstack application, and although it is still in the development stage, I can already say it will be related to one of my biggest hobbies: ðŸŽ¬ *movies* ðŸŽ¬
- ðŸŒ³ I love plants and I've been learning about tree grafting. Who knows, maybe soon I'll get to pick up lemons and avos from my own trees.
