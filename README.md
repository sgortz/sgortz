 # Welcome! ✨
👋 Hello, my name is Sabrina, I’m currently a student at Hack Reactor, and I'm super excited to start my career as a Software Engineer!

### Here's some interesting facts about me:
- 👌 I just finished a pretty cool project where I had to design, implement, and deploy using AWS an API that supports an e-commerce application designed by my peers at Hack Reactor
- 👽 I’m currently working on a fullstack application, and although it is still in the development stage, I can already say it will be related to one of my biggest hobbies: 🎬 *movies* 🎬
- 😅 I’m currently learning Gatsby JS, and Firebase for this project
- 🌳 Fun fact: I love plants and I've been obsessed with creating moss terrariums
- 👍 My pronouns are: she, her, hers
