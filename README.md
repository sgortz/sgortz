 # Welcome 👋
 
🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm a frontend-driven, backend-enthusiast, and plant freak 🪴 software engineer.

🤍 I'm really passionate about projects that challenge me, and I dislike the feeling of being stuck in my comfort zone.

🌟 My tech stack: C#, JS and Python.

👩‍💻 Next on the study list: Go and Java.
